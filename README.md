### November 4th:
Code Project (  approx 45 min...)

1.) Stood up initial project for prototyping out the Oauth auth flow I want to test.

2.) Going to start with just a server file request to the Spotify Oauth2 endpoint with my 
creds as test ENV vars.

3.) Stopped and realized I should read the Developer Agreements and get my Spotify App Authorization sorted out before I write too much code. 

4.) Read through developer agreement for using Spotify API/Platform for a non-streaming application/service.

5.) I'm pretty sure I'm all set- no foreseeable violations of the TOS.  Sent Branding Guidelines to my friend who is doing UX/UI and front-end coding when we get to it. 

Other Reading ( approx 15 min):

1.)  Reading up on GraphQL to see if it's something I can leverage at work/outside of work.

2.) Diggin in on I/O Bound vs. CPU Bound applications.  https://bytearcher.com/articles/io-vs-cpu-bound/  Part of deeper learning on Node.js and what problem space it works best in. 


### November 5th:

1.) 20 minutes of deep stretching.

2.) Reading into Elastic Search and Apache Lucene. Very intrigued by the speed and scale of how this can handle massive data sets. (15 min)

3.) Reading about Elixir language.

4.) Created a small hello world app in Elixir. (5 min)


### November 6th:

1.) Reading and learning more about ElasticSearch and its use cases.  

2.) Playing around with an interactive tutorial on GraphQL. https://app.graphqleditor.com/?category=tutorial&visibleMenu=code

3.) More exploration of Elixir.  Learing about function arity and some more basics.

4.) Went down a rabbit hole on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) as it relates to Databases. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID



### November 7th: 

1.) 20 minutes reading through RabbitMQ documentation.  RabbitMQ is a messaging system used to solve for a variety of problems and create some cool features for apps.
