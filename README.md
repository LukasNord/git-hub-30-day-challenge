# git-hub-30-day-challenge
Doing the Prime Github 30 Day Challenge and using this as my daily change log.  Commits will be from other projects will be logged here.

# Plan:
- Start: Work on building a Progressive Web App that allows friends to build playlists together using Spotify and OAuth2.0

- Start: Unity3D C# tutorials for game development.  

- Continue: Reading JavaScript Design Patterns (https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

- Continue: Finish reading through the last few books in the 'You Don't Know JavaScript' series.      (https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md)

- Continue: Strength Training 3x a week.

## Code Projects:
 OAuth2.0 enabled Spotify API wrapper. Crowd-source playlists with your friends.
 

## Booklist: 

1.) You Don't Know JS series.

2.) JavaScript Design Patterns: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/



### November 4th:
Code Project (  approx 45 min...)

1.) Stood up initial project for prototyping out the Oauth auth flow I want to test.

2.) Going to start with just a server file request to the Spotify Oauth2 endpoint with my 
creds as test ENV vars.

3.) Stopped and realized I should read the Developer Agreements and get my Spotify App Authorization sorted out before I write too much code. 

4.) Read through developer agreement for using Spotify API/Platform for a non-streaming application/service.

5.) I'm pretty sure I'm all set- no foreseeable violations of the TOS.  Sent Branding Guidelines to my friend who is doing UX/UI and front-end coding when we get to it. 

Other Reading ( approx 15 min):

1.)  Reading up on GraphQL to see if it's something I can leverage at work/outside of work.

2.) Diggin in on I/O Bound vs. CPU Bound applications.  https://bytearcher.com/articles/io-vs-cpu-bound/  Part of deeper learning on Node.js and what problem space it works best in. 


### November 5th:

1.) 20 minutes of deep stretching.

2.) Reading into Elastic Search and Apache Lucene. Very intrigued by the speed and scale of how this can handle massive data sets. (15 min)

3.) Reading about Elixir language.

4.) Created a small hello world app in Elixir. (5 min)


### November 6th:

1.) Reading and learning more about ElasticSearch and its use cases.  

2.) Playing around with an interactive tutorial on GraphQL. https://app.graphqleditor.com/?category=tutorial&visibleMenu=code

3.) More exploration of Elixir.  Learing about function arity and some more basics.

4.) Went down a rabbit hole on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) as it relates to Databases. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID



### November 7th: 

1.) 20 minutes reading through RabbitMQ documentation.  RabbitMQ is a messaging system used to solve for a variety of problems and create some cool features for apps.

### November 8th: 
1.) Worker Threads in Node.js kind of blew my mind.  https://medium.com/@Trott/using-worker-threads-in-node-js-part-2-a9405c72a6f0
 If heavy compute jobs can be solved reliably with this then Node is going to be a powerhouse for all types of servers. 

### November 9th: 

1.) Found a nice template for Node/Express TypeScript with a few auth'd routes set up.  Good starting layer for what we'll be working on.  Read through all the libs and code used by the template to understand what/why I'm installing it versus rolling my own. 
 -  Next step: build or find a Spotify Web Client for handling the [Authorization Code Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) flow.
 -  Write Jest Tests to cover what's already been written.  
 -  Build dummy API to ping to trigger and test the login to Spotify.
 -  Write tests. Then write more tests.  
 
 ### November 10th:
 1.) Stretching and body weight workout.
 
 2.) Reading for pleasure.
 
 
 ### November 11th:
1.) Reading on Kubernetes uses and approaches to adopting it.  https://www.docker.com/blog/designing-your-first-app-kubernetes-overview/


### November 12th: 

1.) Digging into more advanced features of TypeScript.  Reading up on best ways to port projects over to it. 

### November 13th:

1.) Chagned it up and went down a rabbit hole of YouTube videos from the Low Level JavaScript Channel.  Fascinating stuff!
   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56l7uZA209tlPTVOJiJ8Tw


### November 14th: 
1.) Delayed commit: Set up a small side project to test OAuth out.  Started writing a few routes on the main project.


### November 15th: :

Missed a day!

### November 16th: 

Went to a local Application Security meetup to discuss and learn about security practices in web development.


### November 17th: 

Read a few chapters of `this & Object Prototypes`  from the You Don't Know JS series.
