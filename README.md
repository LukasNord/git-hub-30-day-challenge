# git-hub-30-day-challenge
Doing the Prime GH30C. Using this as my daily log to write about things learned each day. Starts November 4th.

# Plan:
1.) Work on my side project at least 30 minutes each day.
2.) If the day's schedule doesn't lend itself to coding, read an article or book on programming.

## Code Projects:
 OAuth2.0 enabled Spotify API wrapper. Crowd-source playlists with your friends.
 

## Booklist: 

1.) You Don't Know JS series.

2.) JavaScript Design Patterns: https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/



### November 4th:
Code Project (  approx 45 min...)

1.) Stood up initial project for prototyping out the Oauth auth flow I want to test.

2.) Going to start with just a server file request to the Spotify Oauth2 endpoint with my 
creds as test ENV vars.

3.) Stopped and realized I should read the Developer Agreements and get my Spotify App Authorization sorted out before I write too much code. 

4.) Read through developer agreement for using Spotify API/Platform for a non-streaming application/service.

5.) I'm pretty sure I'm all set- no foreseeable violations of the TOS.  Sent Branding Guidelines to my friend who is doing UX/UI and front-end coding when we get to it. 

Other Reading ( approx 15 min):

1.)  Reading up on GraphQL to see if it's something I can leverage at work/outside of work.

2.) Diggin in on I/O Bound vs. CPU Bound applications.  https://bytearcher.com/articles/io-vs-cpu-bound/  Part of deeper learning on Node.js and what problem space it works best in.
